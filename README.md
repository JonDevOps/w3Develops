# Welcome to W3Develops' open source codebase
## What is W3Develops?

[W3Develops](https://w3develops.org/) is a community where like minded individuals can learn new technologies and build together to level up their knowledge and have projects to showcase to further their career. This website has many features and is continueously adding more such as a programmer meetup tracker, online and in person meetups, podcasts, video walkthroughs, study groups, building groups, a job board, internships, a forum, a social network, and more.


The goal of W3Develops is to provide a simple learning, collaborating, networking website for programmers.

It is not "industry quality", with an emphasis on allowing the novice user to be able to contribute to the code.

It is a work in progress and is not feature complete at this point, however it is usable as an educational tool.

W3Develops has the following constraint:

It's free so resources are sometimes stretched.
